## Alumni Bridge: Reconnect and Rekindle Alumni Connections

Alumni Management System Using Python &amp; MySQL<br><br>
A great alumni network is extremely important for the
success of an educational institution. Once out of the
institution, students are provided with an option to enroll
as alumni, which lets them act as mentors for future
generations. Besides, aspiring candidates can also look
forward to job opportunities or a prospective client base
that can help in their business. While most of the
participation is voluntary these individual alumni manage to
contribute and support the institution, particularly when
needed.<br><br>
