Alumni Management System Using Python &amp; MySQL<br><br>
A great alumni network is extremely important for the
success of an educational institution. Once out of the
institution, students are provided with an option to enroll
as alumni, which lets them act as mentors for future
generations. Besides, aspiring candidates can also look
forward to job opportunities or a prospective client base
that can help in their business. While most of the
participation is voluntary these individual alumni manage to
contribute and support the institution, particularly when
needed.<br><br>

1. Register Alumni<br>

Built-In Modules Used :<br><br>
import mysql.connector :<br>
By importing this package, we are able to establish the connection
between SQL and Python.<br>
import random :<br>
This package has functionality to generate random numbers and select
numbers within a range.<br><br>
The project is written in Python Language along with the connection with a local database (known as "alumni") which consists of two tables or relations (named as "alureg" and "event").<br>
All the operations are performed on the data stored in the database.
